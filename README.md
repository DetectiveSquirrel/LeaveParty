LeaveParty

Just a simple plugin to leave party. There is a single setting to bind a key that, when pressed, do the following:

1. Open the social panel if it's not already open
2. Click the party tab
3. Click the leave button
4. Close the social tab

To install, just create a directory in the PoEHud\plugins directory named LeaveParty and drop the DLL inside.
